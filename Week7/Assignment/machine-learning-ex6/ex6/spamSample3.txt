This week's five links that are worth your time:

1. freeCodeCamp just published a free 10-hour Python Data Analysis course. You can learn Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and other key data science tools. This course is taught by a former Twitter engineer, IIT grad, and ACM ICPC world finalist. (10 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-analyze-data-with-python-pandas/

Quote of the Week: “I never guess. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.” – Sir Arthur Conan Doyle


A quick update on our data science curriculum pledge drive. So far the freeCodeCamp community has raised $45,256 from 881 kind donors. Our goal is to raise $150,000, all of which will be 100% matched by educator-turned-benefactor Darrell Silver. This means that if you donate, say $50, it will translate into $100 worth of budget for us to hire experienced teachers to design these math and machine learning courses.

Happy coding.
